# MIT Cheetah on the STM32MP1 (Octavo OSD32MP1)

A port of MIT Biomimetics' [Cheetah-Software](https://github.com/mit-biomimetics/Cheetah-Software)
to run its locomotion control stack on an **Octavo OSD32MP1** (STM32MP157: dual
Cortex-A7 running Linux + a Cortex-M4), driving **Unitree RS485 legs**, with a
**Gazebo (Go1) software-in-the-loop** simulation for development and — the end goal —
**OpenPilot-style waypoint navigation**.

> Fork of MIT Cheetah-Software (BSD-3, see `LICENSE`). All original build/run docs
> for the desktop + Mini Cheetah still apply; this README covers the STM32MP1 port,
> which lives under **`stm32mp1/`**. See also `CLAUDE.md` (rules + traps) and
> `SKILLS.md` (the exact commands).

## Why the STM32MP1

The MIT stack ran the locomotion controller on an x86 computer and the motor I/O on
separate SPI "spine" boards, with a Jetson only for perception. The STM32MP1 collapses
**control brain + motor I/O onto one chip**: the A7/Linux cores run the Cheetah
controller, and motor I/O (Unitree RS485, or CAN sensors) runs on the same SoC. No
GPU is needed for locomotion — perception/ROS stays separate and optional.

## Status

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Cross-build (Mac → armv7) | ✅ `libbiomimetics.a` + JCQP/osqp/etc. build for Cortex-A7 |
| Unitree RS485 actuator driver | ✅ compiles + probe; **not hardware-validated** (no adapter yet) |
| CAN IMU (DroneCAN) + AHRS | ✅ validated on the live bus (~490 Hz) |
| `jpos_ctrl` on the board | ✅ runs the control loop on real hardware |
| **Gazebo Go1 SITL** | ✅ **controller on the MP1 stands/squats a simulated Go1 over UDP, with IMU/baro/GPS** |
| MIT_Controller (MPC + WBC) locomotion | ✅ **walks** — 100 m continuous under `walking2`; 4 of MIT's 8 gaits functional |
| OpenPilot waypoint navigation | ✅ **GPS star mission complete under convex MPC** (5 × 10.1 m legs, 85.3 s) |
| Mac-first host build | ✅ same source builds natively (`-DSTM32MP1_HOST=ON`) for fast iteration |
| Robot model vs the real Go1 | ✅ **corrected against Unitree's own binary** (see `docs/LEGGED_SPORT_REVERSE.md`) |

## Measured locomotion (Mac SITL, cheater state)

100 m dash on flat ground, fastest speed each gait completes it. Ceilings
verified by repeats at the next speed up, not by a single pass.

| gait | max speed | 100 m time | cruise |
|---|---|---|---|
| `walking2` (21) | 1.0 m/s | **106.8 s** | 0.94 m/s |
| `trotting` (9) | 0.9 m/s | **120.4 s** | 0.83 m/s |
| `pacing` (8) | 0.8 m/s | **130.5 s** | 0.77 m/s |
| `trotRunning` (5) | 0.6 m/s | **186.1 s** | 0.53 m/s |
| `walking` (20) | — | never crosses (best 17.6 m) | — |
| `bounding` (1) | — | never crosses (best 5.5 m @ 1.0) | — |
| `pronking` (2) / `galloping` (22) | — | never cross (< 0.3 m) | — |

**Four of MIT's eight gaits run 100 m.** Two of those - pacing and trotRunning -
were completely dead before the factory-binary comparison (0.1 m and 0.00 m);
they were recovered by a real defect it exposed, not by tuning. See
`docs/LEGGED_SPORT_REVERSE.md`.

Reality check against the machine: a Go1 Air does 2.5 m/s, a Pro 3.5-3.7, an Edu
sprints to 4.7. **This stack tops out at 0.94 m/s** - about a fifth of the
sprint, and slower than a person walking. That ceiling has not moved; what
improved is breadth and robustness (twice as many working gaits, heading held to
centimetres, 100 m sustained instead of ~20 m). The gaits that could go fast are
the flight-phase ones, and three of the four still do not hold up.

## Reverse-engineering the factory controller

`docs/LEGGED_SPORT_REVERSE.md` documents the analysis of Unitree's shipped
`Legged_sport`: it is a direct MIT Cheetah-Software fork (MIT's source tree
verbatim in its DWARF paths, MIT licence shipped alongside), which makes it an
authoritative reference for parameterising this stack for a Go1. It corrected
six wrong constants in this port — including a knee gear ratio (9.4995, not
6.33) that removes a field this port had invented, and an MPC inertia tensor
that was under-estimating roll and yaw by ~25%.

## Quick start

**Cross-compile (on a Mac with the toolchain):**
```bash
brew tap messense/macos-cross-toolchains && brew install arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
stm32mp1/build.sh                 # -> mp1-build/robot/{jpos_ctrl,jpos_ctrl_sim,stand_sim}
stm32mp1/deploy.sh push <board-ip> /usr/local/cheetah-mp1
```

**Gazebo SITL (Go1) — Gazebo on the Mac, controller on the board:**
```bash
stm32mp1/gazebo/run_gazebo_sim.sh                 # Mac: Gazebo (headless) + bridge
ssh <board-ip> 'cd /usr/local/cheetah-mp1 && ./stand_sim <mac-ip>'   # board: stand + squat
```

See `SKILLS.md` for hardware bring-up, the sensor/actuator probes, and debugging.
